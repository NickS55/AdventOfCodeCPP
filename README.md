# AdventOfCodeCPP

This is my personal repository containing original solutions for [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about), written in C++.

The repository includes a build script, inputs, code, and answers.

***While these solutions work, I would not suggest using them for reference. I am using Advent of Code problems to help me learn C++.*** 

## How to Run on Mac
